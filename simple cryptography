# processing: adds a number of random letters (A-Z; a-z) after each letter

#             we could generate any of the following:

# function:   remove_letters
# input:      a word to unscramble (String) and the number of characters to remove (integer)
# processing: the function starts at the first position in the supplied word and keeps it.
#             it then removes "num" characters from the word. the process is repeated again
#             if the word contains additional characters - the next character is kept
#             and "num" more characters are removed.  For example, if word="cZaYtU" and
#             num=1 the function will generate the following:
#        
#             cat (keeping character 0, removing character 1, keeping character 2, removing
#                  character 3, keeping character 4, removing character 5)

# function:   shift_characters
# input:      a word (String) and a number of characters to shift (integer)
# processing: shifts each character in the supplied word to another position in the ASCII
#             table. the new position is dictated by the supplied integer.  for example,
#             if word = "apple" and num=1 the newly generated word would be:
#
#             bqqmf
#
#             because we added +1 to each character. if we were to call the function with
#             word = "bqqmf" and num=-1 the newly generated word would be:
#           
#             apple
#
#             because we added -1 to each character, which shifted each character down by
#             one position on the ASCII table.
#
# output:     returns the newly generated word
